            <p>Since its inception in 2015, TechCon Conference has grown into one of the premier gatherings for technology professionals, innovators, 
                and thought leaders from around the world. Originally launched as a small developer meetup in San Francisco, TechCon has evolved into a global 
                technology summit, attracting thousands of attendees annually from sectors including software development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity,
                 cloud computing, and emerging tech.</p><br>
